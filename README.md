### delete_node_modules
The delete_node_modules script is a Bash script that deletes the node_modules directory from all subdirectories within a specified parent directory. It uses the rm -rf command to recursively delete the directory and all its contents. The script also outputs progress information as it processes each subdirectory, and indicates when it's done.

To use the script:

1. Change to the parent directory containing all the subdirectories you want to clean up. For example, cd projects.
2. Copy the delnm.sh file to the parent directory.
3. Make the script executable by running chmod +x delnm.sh.
4. Run the script using ./delnm.sh.

Here's an example directory structure:

```
projects/
  project1/
  project2/
  project3/
```
In this case, the script would delete the node_modules directory from project1, project2, and project3.
